## General Info
I created this project as part of Codecademy's curriculum. The scenerio below is made up.

Vancouver’s public metro system has asked me to help create a program to help commuters get from one landmark to another. I built “SkyRoute,” a routing tool that uses breadth-first search, depth-first search, and Python dictionaries to accomplish this. In this project, it is assumed that it takes the same amount of time to get from each station to each of its connected neighboring stations.
## Technologies
+ Python
## Features
+ Employees of Vancouver's public metro system are able to update SkyRoute when a station is under construction, so that SkyRoute knows not to send commuters to that station.
+ To update a station under construction, employees type in their employee id, then the name of the station.
+ After that, SkyRoute asks if they want to update another station.
+ Commuters are welcomed, then given a choice of landmarks in Vancouver, and they select which landmark they are closest to, and which landmark they want to go to.
+ SkyRoute then gives them the shortest metro route between the two landmarks, showing each station along the way.
+ Once they have seen a route, commuters are asked whether or not they want to see another route.
+ If no other route is requested, Skyroute thanks the commuter for using SkyRoute.
